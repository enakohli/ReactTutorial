# ReactTutorial

A react tutorial following this series by Codevolution: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFaFIcGhPoM&list=PLC3y8-rFHvwgg3vaYJgHGnModB54rxOk3

I learned the basics of:
- Class Components
- Functional Components
- JSX
- Props and State
- Event Handling
- Conditionals
- Lists and Keys
- Styling
- Forms
- Mounting and Updating Lifecycle
- Pure Components
- Memos
- Refs
- Portals
- Error Boundaries
- Higher Order Components
- Render Props

I was able to use all that I learned, for my software developer co-op in the Ontario Digital Service, and was able to apply this tutorial to learn styled components, and create applications utilizing React.
